In this project I have analyzed the Vrinda Store dataset of 2022 using Excel.


This store had some questions to address after analyzing the Dataset Provided by them.

So that they can make necessary decisions for 2023 market.



 
I had provided the required insights to address their queries and improve their business by taking necessary decisions.




Created dashboards to ease them to access data whatever they needed.






In this Project I have worked on different features of Excel like data cleaning, data transformation, data processing, pivot table, Power pivot,slicers and Charts etc.




Here I am attaching the sample screenshot of dashboard I have created.
